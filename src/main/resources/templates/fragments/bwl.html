                                The <b>T-Panel</b> is Better Way Lighting's upcoming new panel light whose design and
                                software was created in-house. The T-Panel is Better Way Lighting's first panel light
                                that is made to be comparable to other panel lights in white output but is lighter,
                                easier to rig, and less expensive. The T-Panel is also designed to fit accessories made
                                for other panel lights of the same size.
                            </p>

                                Since the T-Panel has not been released at ny the time I finished my co-op, several
                                details about the panel have been omitted, including the official name of the panel.

                                I worked on the design, layout, and behaviour of the T-Panel's UI, as well as connecting
                                the UI to the data model and device backend. I also added new data model entries and
                                backend functionality as needed to implement new features or modify existing features
                                and UI behaviour.

                                I started designing the UI by first making a list of all the potential features and UI

                                specifications. Using the list, I designed mockups of the UI cards and layout in Figma
                                based on the UI library used on our other devices that use the smaller variant of the
                                T-Panel screen.

                                After going through the UI mockups with the team, we decided on the device and UI
                                features we wanted to include from the UI mockups, as well as the design of the UI
                                cards. Based on the new feature list, I created flow charts for each of the potential UI
                                layouts. Using the layout flow charts, the team decided on a single menu layout that
                                updates to show control mode-specific settings based on the selected control mode.

                                Using the UI mockups, I test-coded test versions of the UI cards with and without the
                                menu title to roughly determine the layout of the cards and the font sizes. Based on the
                                feedback from the team, we determined the layout of the card elements and chose font
                                sizes that allowed us to fit at least 3 lines of text on the display. Based on the test
                                versions of the UI cards, I created a mockup list of the basic card types and font size
                                options. The card type mockup list was then sent to the design team to finalize the
                                design of the UI cards.

                                a separate code repository while the backend and data model was being built. I also
                                imported and modified existing custom cards we needed from the other devices using the
                                same UI library and created some additional new custom cards. While coding the T-Panel
                                UI, I also added dummy callback functions to the cards that require them in preparation
                                for connecting the UI with the data model and backend.

                                After linking the initial UI to the initial data model and backend, the team began
                                implementing new major features and adjusting the behaviour of existing features and the
                                UI. Once the major features were added, we then began adding the minor features we
                                wanted to have for release. I assisted in modifying and adding to the UI, data model,
                                and backend based on the features and device behaviours we wanted. As of the writing of
                                this report, the final remaining features for the T-Panel release are being added.

                                Some of the features I added or assisted in adding the UI, data model entries and
                                backend for include the adjustable lock timeout, several warning and status modals,
                                navigating to the status screen on encoder scroll and UI lock, device temperature
                                display, and allowing users to set the flash button output to the current light output.
                                I also helped add development-only behaviour and UI cards to make it easier to test the
                                device.

                                This was my first time working on a physical device for release and on a lighting
                                product. From this project, I was able to gain experience in building the software for a
                                lighting device, designing and building the on-device UI, and working with embedded
                                systems. I was also able to improve my skills in designing and building the UI and
                                features so that they behave as expected by the users.

                                Throughout this project, I was able to utilize my UI design and coding skills, as well

                                code the various UI cards and backend functionality.

                                this project and utilize them in future projects.
