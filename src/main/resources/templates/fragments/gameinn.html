                                    In a team of 5, create a Java Spring Boot web app that solves or improves on existing solutions to a non-trival problem. The app must be hosted on Heroku include a login, store and retrieve data from the apps
                                    Postgres database, have different views for at least 2 user types, and use data from a Rest API. The app we created was GameInn, a gaming clip sharer and group finder, whiich solves the following problems:

                                    Looking for clips for a game and being able to easily search for them is difficult as there are several sites commonly used to share clips (Facebook, Youtube,Twitch, Twitter, etc.), and clips are not guarenteed to
                                    be crossposted between these sites.

                                <li>
                                    While several group finder apps exist, no group finder exists where you can also see the social media accounts of the users you are playing with. Additionally, most group finder apps only include a limited list of
                                    games users are able to create groups for.
                                </li>

                                    GameInn currently supports 3 types of users: guests, registerd users, and admin. Guests can only view the clips list and group finder list. Registerd users have all the privalages of guests, but can additionally
                                    add/edit their own clips and create/join groups. Admins have all the privaledges of registered users, but can additionally delete any clips and groups.

                                    The project began with the project proposal, followed by the UI mockups, which outlined the structure of our app and the features we wanted to include. Next we began incrementally developing and coding the front
                                    and back end of our app. I designed the overall layout of our app and coded the Ajax and Java API calls to the Twitch API to get the top 50 game titles in alphabetical order based on the user’s input as they type.
                                    I also in coded the back end to create and insert the correct embed code based on the clip and it’s platform, and designed and coaded the user profile social media editing UI and functionality.

                                    One challenge I ran into was getting the list of game titles for the clips and group finder. Originally, we used the IGDB API to get the game titles. However, since IGDB uses user submitted data, there were many
                                    games listed that would not be usefull for use in our app (foreign games, single player games, old games not played anymore, etc.). The solution that my team and I came up with was to switch to the Twitch API,
                                    since Twitch keeps their game list up-to-date with the most relevent games, old and new. We were still able to use the IGDB API Java wrapper for authentication since IGDB is owned by Twitch and uses Twitch
                                    authentication for API calls.

                                    Another challenge I ran into was getting the clips based on the user inputted link. Each platform we wanted to use either has a different embed code from the other platforms or no embed code at all. Additionally,
                                    some platforms only allow you to embed the entire post and not just the video/clip. While it would have been easier to embed the clips and posts using each platforms API, there was not enough time to learn each
                                    platfroms API and set up any necessary authentication. As well, some platforms require approval before using their API, which we did not have time to wait for and has the potential for us to be denied access. I
                                    solved this issue by limiting the platforms to just YouTube, Twitch, Twitter, and Reddit, since either the embed code was easy to generate on the spot (Twitter) or the details needed for the embed code were easy to
                                    obtain (YouTube, Twitch, Reddit). After confirming the link entered matches the valid link types for the selected platform, the embed coad is created in the back end and stored in the databse, making it easy to
                                    retrieve.

                                    Switching from the IGDB API to the Twitch API made it easy to get relevant game titles. Additionally, the Twitch API has a bunch of features that we could potentially in the future. Limiting the clip platforms and
                                    creating the template functions in the back end to create the embed code made it quick and easy to embed the clips and posts using just a user inputted link.

                                    Through this project, I learned how to use Java for web design, Spring Boot, and Postgres. I also applied my web design and web programming skills, resulting in a simple to use clip sahrer and group finder.
                                    However, there were some features we counldn't implement due to time, such as selecting from the queued users to join your group and notifying them, viewing other user profiles, add a built-in chat system, and clip
