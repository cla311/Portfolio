                                    One challenge I ran into was getting columns with images to behave properly in accordions. When an column component with images was added to an accordion, the image columns would behave opposite to the accordion
                                    (shown, when accordion is closes, hidden when accordion was open). I initially tried fixing this by adding the images to the text component above where the images were supposed to go. However, this made it
                                    difficult to arrange the images and have the images dynamically resize based on the screen size. While it would have theoretically been to fix this with custom CSS classes, this would have taken a lot of time. The
                                    solution I ended up with was to revert to using the column component and create custom a JavaScript/jQuery script to reverse the behaviour of the image columns to match the behaviour of the accordions. This also
                                    allowed me to use the column component layout and dynamic sizing features instead of needing to custom code them.

                                    Another challenge I ran into was getting the custom RSVP bar to display correctly. When designing the custom RSVP bar, I ran into and issue with the RSVP button not positioning and behaving correctly. Originally,
                                    the RSVP button would touch the edge of the RSVP bar's background on large screens with a huge gap between it and the RSVP text. Additionally, as the screen size/window decreases to the tablet screen size, the
                                    background would shrink more than the RSVP button, causing the button to extend past the edge of the bacground. I tried fixing these issues by messing with the margin and padding of the RSVP bar itself and the
                                    button which did not work. I then tried changing the CSS display property for the button to see if it would reslove the issues. After trying several disolay types, I found that setting the button to display as an
                                    inline-table fixed the positioning and spacing issues and alowed for the spacing between the text and button to be adjusted.

                                    During my co-op work term, I finished building the remaining important pages for launch (over 150 pages) and edited the pages on the new website as needed. Additionally, I built and styled several new custom
                                    components that came up as I was building pages. I also helped edit the CSS styles of various components based on feedback from our user testing, the design agency we were working with, the Design Lead, the

                                    before the end of my co-op work term that we did not have time to implement. However, since the website is being constantly updated and we had trained the rest of the SFU Public Square team that wasn't already
