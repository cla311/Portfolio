# Portfolio

Custom coded portfolio using Java Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, and Bootstrap 5. Portfolio hosted on Qoddi and database hosted on Neon (neon.tech).

Based on my original portfolio which originally used a static Bootstrap 4 template. A version of the portfolio was built using Docker for a different host, which ended up not working due to host limitations.
